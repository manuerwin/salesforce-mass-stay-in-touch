Mass Stay In Touch
==================

There are no apps (that I could find) on AppExchange that enable configurable/customisable Mass Stay In Touch (MSIT), nor is Salesforce Product Management planning on updating the current functionality anytime soon due to a general 8% response on Stay In Touch requests.
The only app with promise is a managed package (Contact Update Request https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N3000000B4QhlEAF) that only works for single stay in touch functionality. The publisher has been asked if they are considering a mass version, however no response has been received at date of writing.

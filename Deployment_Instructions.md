# Purpose
Provide steps to implement this functionality into a testing environment while development is still occurring.

# 1) Manually create Site
You need to create the Site first so the Site Guest profile (Mass Stay In Touch Profile) will be created and to enable the subsequent metadata deploy to match.
Navigate to Setup, enter Sites in "Quick Find" anc click through.
Create a New Site with the following details (make sure they are exactly the same otherwise the subsequent metadata won't match):
1 Site Label: Mass Stay In Touch
2 Site Name: Mass_Stay_In_Touch
3 Default Web Address: stayingintouch
4 Active Site Home Page: InMaintenance
5 Leave all other default values and click Save
